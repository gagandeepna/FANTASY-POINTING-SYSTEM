#FANTASY-POINTING-SYSTEM

Fantasy Pointing System is a system that assigns points for a sports person’s overall performance in a particular match. 
This fantasy pointing system takes input from the user for getting to know the cricketer’s performance in a specific T20 cricket match. 
Then it calculates the fantasy points for every loss and gain of the cricketer, giving justified value to the player’s performance in the game by using the input given by the user. 
It points out all the misinformation provided by the user according to the standard ICC T20 rules. 
Then it sums up all the individual points awarded for the player’s performance and prints the total fantasy points. 
Using the total fantasy points scored by the player in a match, one can organize Cricket Fantasy Leagues, rank batters, bowlers and all-rounders all in one rank list, and use this data to identify the most valuable player in a given tournament.
